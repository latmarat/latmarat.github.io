	abstract = {In the present contribution, a phenomenological constitutive model of medium manganese steels, in which both twinning-induced (TWIP) and transformation-induced (TRIP) plasticity enhancing mechanisms are activated, is implemented in the finite element framework. The implementation is utilized for the analysis of the full-field strain partitioning in dual-phase microstructure maps obtained from electron backscattering diffraction. The results of the finite element analysis suggest that the strain localization in the studied steel has an alternating character. Specifically, in the low strain region, most of the externally imposed deformation is accommodated by the initially softer austenite. The higher strain hardening rate of austenite due to deformation twinning (TWIP effect) and the mechanically-induced transformation to martensite (TRIP effect) results in a shift of the strain localization to ferrite. This alternating strain localization is a key feature that distinguishes the medium manganese TWIP+TRIP steel. It is shown that this alternating strain localization contributes to the superior mechanical behavior of medium manganese TWIP+TRIP steel reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {There is a critical need for the development and verification of practically useful multiscale modeling strategies for simulating the mechanical response of multiphase metallic materials with heterogeneous microstructures. In this contribution, we present data-driven reduced order models for effective yield strength and strain partitioning in such microstructures. These models are built employing the recently developed framework of Materials Knowledge Systems that employ 2-point spatial correlations (or 2-point statistics) for the quantification of the heterostructures and principal component analyses for their low-dimensional representation. The models are calibrated to a large collection of finite element (FE) results obtained for a diverse range of microstructures with various sizes, shapes, and volume fractions of the phases. The performance of the models is evaluated by comparing the predictions of yield strength and strain partitioning in two-phase materials with the corresponding predictions from a classical self-consistent model as well as results of full-field FE simulations. The reduced-order models developed in this work show an excellent combination of accuracy and computational efficiency, and therefore present an important advance towards computationally efficient microstructure-sensitive multiscale modeling frameworks.},

	abstract = {In this work, we investigate the relationship between an intense slip band (ISB) and the zone of large lattice rotations that forms ahead of the tip of the ISB. We develop a crystal plasticity finite element model of a discrete ISB lying within an oligocrystalline assembly and calculate the local crystalline stress and lattice rotation fields generated by the ISB. The calculations demonstrate that, first, a region of severe lattice rotations, commonly referred to as a microvolume, does not form without the ISB, and second, large amounts of accumulated slip in the ISB are required to enlarge the microvolume to sizes and rotation magnitudes observed experimentally. Ahead of the ISB tip, the quintessential plastic zone always forms, but the atypical microvolume forms when non-concentrated and spatially diffuse slip is activated by the ISB-induced stress field. This result suggests that the detrimental ISB/microvolume pair will likely appear in pairs of crystals in which transmission of the slip from the ISB is severely blocked by the grain boundary, a hypothesis that we verify with a few target cases.},

	abstract = {In this contribution, we present a new Materials Knowledge System framework for microstructure-sensitive predictions of effective stress–strain responses in composite materials. The model is developed for composites with a wide range of combinations of strain hardening laws and topologies of the constituents. The theoretical foundation of the model is inspired by statistical continuum theories, leveraged by mean-field approximation of self-consistent models, and calibrated to data obtained from micromechanical finite element simulations. The model also relies on newly formulated data-driven linkages between micromechanical responses (phase-average strain rates and effective strength) and microstructure as well as strength contrast of the constituents. The paper describes in detail the theoretical development of the model, its implementation into an efficient computational plasticity framework, calibration of the linkages, and demonstration of the model predictions on two-phase composites with isotropic constituents exhibiting linear and power-law strain hardening laws. It is shown that the model reproduces finite element results reasonably well with significant savings of the computational cost.},

Based on these results, we discuss how topological and crystallographic features of annealing twin boundaries can increase the likelihood of slip band initiation throughout the microstructure of polycrystalline Ni-base superalloys.},

	abstract = {Using a combination of in-situ high-resolution digital image correlation (HR-DIC), Heaviside-DIC method (H-DIC), and crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE), we investigate the evolution of intragranular lattice rotations and slip activity during monotonic and cyclic loading in a high performance, polycrystalline face centered cubic material. The CPFE employs a quasi-3D model microstructure, which is a highly resolved mirror representation of the experimental in-situ test sample. In agreement, the measurements and calculations reveal that most grains, regardless of their size and lattice orientation, develop intragranular lattice rotation gradients that span the grain. For a small cluster of grains on the deformed material, we perform HR-DIC analysis of slip lines to demonstrate agreement in the active slip systems and changes in this local slip activity across the individual grains. The combined analysis reveals that deforming grains are divided into sub-granular regions of uniform lattice rotation and these regions are most often associated with only one or two active slip systems. The gradient lines that divide them correspond to changes in the predominant slip system. The model is used to examine the evolution of intragranular lattice rotation in a single fully reversed tension-compression cycle. The calculations indicate that intragranular gradients intensify during the reverse loading path as nearest neighboring regions appear to shed lattice rotation, increasing the lattice rotation in some regions, while shutting down rotation in neighboring regions. These findings provide insight into the irreversible changes that develop within deforming grains at the scale of the grain, particularly the heterogeneous development of intragranular lattice rotation in early stages of deformation, which could serve as precursors to localization.},
